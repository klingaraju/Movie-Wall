# Movie-Wall
This interactive program displays a page of movies and roles. when provided with an actor name. It takes in a csv file as the only argument. The information in the csv file is stored in a hashmap, with the actor names as the keys, and Actor objects as the contents. The hashmap's keys are put into an arrayList and sorted using merge sort. Based on the user's input, the arrayList of keys is searched using binary search. If an exact match of the input is not found, the closest actor name (alphabetically) is displayed, asking if this is what the user meant. If it is, it displays all the movies and roles of the closest actor. If it wasn't what the user was looking for, it asks for another input. If an exact match is found, that actor's movies and roles are displayed.
