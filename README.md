# Movie-Wall
The DisplayWall Class is used to take input from the user and output the neccessary information. It is the driver class. //
The MovieData Class is used to parse through the file and create an arrayList of Actor objects. It returns an arrayList of all the actor objects. DisplayWall extends this class. //
The Actor Class contains the variables for each Actor object, which is their name, and an arraylist of movies and roles they've acted in. There's also a arrayList of Actor objects. An actor object is created in the driver file, which contains the full arrayList of actors returned from the MovieData class. //
ActorArrayList was a scrapped class used to encapsulate the arraylist of actor objects. Seemed redundant.
